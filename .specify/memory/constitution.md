# Site Portfolio Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
Portfolio websites must prioritize user experience and accessibility; All design decisions should enhance the visitor's ability to understand and appreciate the showcased work; Clear navigation and fast loading times are mandatory requirements.

### II. Clean & Modern Code
All code must follow modern best practices and be maintainable; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be clean, well-commented, and optimized; Use semantic HTML and responsive CSS frameworks to ensure cross-device compatibility.

### III. Performance-First Approach (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All pages must load quickly and efficiently; Images should be optimized, assets minified, and unnecessary dependencies avoided; Performance testing required before deployment with Lighthouse scores above 90 for performance.

### IV. Cross-Browser Compatibility
Portfolio must work consistently across all major browsers; Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge before release; Use feature detection rather than browser detection to ensure broad compatibility.

### V. Security & Privacy
Implement proper security measures to protect user data; All forms should have appropriate validation and sanitization; Follow security best practices for hosting and deployment to prevent vulnerabilities.

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack requirements: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and responsive frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS; Deployment to secure hosting platform with HTTPS; Use of analytics tools should respect user privacy.

## Development Workflow

Code review requirements: All changes must be reviewed before merging; Testing on multiple devices and browsers required; Documentation of new features and changes required in project README.

## Governance

All development must align with these principles; Changes to this constitution require documentation of rationale and approval; All portfolio content must be verified for accuracy and professionalism.
